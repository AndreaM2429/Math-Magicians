## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:
- **To have a Git in your device** : this is in order to clone and modify this project.
- **To have a code editor** :  such as VS code, Atom or another that you would like to use.
- **To have a web local server such as XAMPP** : this is in with the purpose of you will be able to watch the changes you make in the project.
- **Have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS and JS** in order to understand the code and be able to modify the elements you want.
- **Count with Node.js in your device** due to it is a tool needed to run the linters


### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

- Clone this repo on your local device you need to open Git Bash and paste the link with the command
```sh
  cd my-folder-name
  $ git clone https://github.com/AndreaM2429/Math-Magicians.git
```


### Install

In order can run the linters tools you need use the following commands in your local work environment:

```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint@7.x eslint-config-airbnb@18.x eslint-plugin-import@2.x eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.x eslint-plugin-react@7.x eslint-plugin-react-hooks@4.x @babel/eslint-parser@7.x @babel/core@7.x  @babel/plugin-syntax-jsx@7.x  @babel/preset-react@7.x @babel/preset-react@7.x

npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
```
**Note:** About the live server server you need to run the following command inside the directory `math_magicians`.
```
npm start
```

### Usage

Now you are able to modify the files in the `math_magicians/src`, but be careful just modify them, the rest are for the funcionality of the app so **NOT MODIFY THEM**.


### Run tests

To see the linter errors run the following codes for:

- CSS

```sh
 npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
  
 To fix the errors add --fix
```

- JS

```sh
 npx eslint "**/*.{js,jsx}"
  
 To fix the errors add --fix
```


### Available Scripts <a name="scripts"></a>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


### Deployment
